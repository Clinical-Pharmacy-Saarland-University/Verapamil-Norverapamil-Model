## Verapamil-Norverapamil-Model
Mechanistic PBPK model of verapamil (clinical CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitor).

### Repository files
Within this repository, we share a whole-body PBPK model of verapamil that includes the R- and S-enantiomers of verapamil and norverapamil, with PK-Sim observers for total verapamil (and norverapamil) in plasma and urine. The model was developed using data of 45 clinical studies (dosing range 0.1–250 mg), and qualified for DDI prediction with the CYP3A4 and Pgp victim drugs midazolam and digoxin, as well as with the CYP3A4 perpetrator drugs rifampicin and cimetidine. 

The PK-Sim project file contains simulation examples and the observed data of all clinical studies used for model development and evaluation. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].
